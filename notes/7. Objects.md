# Objects 
In TypeScript, objects are used to group related values (properties) together, and you can define the shape (structure) of the object using types.

### Basic Syntax
A basic Person Object:
```
let person: { name: string; age: number } = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 25
};
```

To access the person object:
```
console.log(`Name: ${person.name} Age:${person.age}`)
```
