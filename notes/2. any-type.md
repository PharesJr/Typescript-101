# Any-Type

In TypeScript, the any type means a variable can hold any kind of value, and TypeScript won't check its type.

### ⚠️ Warning:
Use any sparingly, because it disables TypeScript’s type safety. Overusing it can lead to bugs that TypeScript is designed to prevent. Only use it when you truly don't know the type.

#### example:
```
let data: any = 5;
data = "hello"; // No error
data = true;    // Still no error
```
