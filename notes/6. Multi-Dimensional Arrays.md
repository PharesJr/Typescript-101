# Multi-Dimensional Arrays

A multi-dimensional array in TypeScript is an array of arrays â€” like a grid, table, or matrix.

## Basic Syntax

#### For a single Dimension array:
`let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3];`

#### For a 2D array (like a matrix of numbers):
```
let matrix: number[][] = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9]
];
```
**number[][]** means: an array where each item is an array of numbers.

You can access items like this:
`console.log(matrix[1][2]); // Output: 6`
## More Dimensions
#### For a 3D array:
```
let cube: string[][][] = [
[
["a", "b"],
["c", "d"]
],
[
["e", "f"],
["g", "h"]
]
];
```
Here, **string[][][]** is a 3D array of strings.

#### Why Use Multi-Dimensional Arrays?
* For organizing data in tables, grids, coordinates, etc.
* Helps structure complex data in a clean, type-safe way.
