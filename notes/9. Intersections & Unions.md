# Intersection Types
Intersection types in TypeScript are a powerful feature that allows developers to combine multiple types into a single type, creating a new type that has all the properties and behaviors of the combined types. This is particularly useful for modeling complex data structures or ensuring that an object satisfies multiple type constraints.

### example:
```
type Person = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};

type Employee = {
  employeeId: string;
  department: string;
};

type EmployeeProfile = Person & Employee;

const employee: EmployeeProfile = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30,
  employeeId: "E123",
  department: "Engineering"
};
```
In this example:

* **EmployeeProfile** is an intersection of **Person** and **Employee**.
* Any value of type **EmployeeProfile** must have the properties **name, age, employeeId,** and **department**.

If you omit any of these properties, TypeScript will throw a type error:

```
const invalidEmployee: EmployeeProfile = {
  name: "Bob",
  age: 25,
  // Error: Property 'employeeId' is missing
  // Error: Property 'department' is missing
};
```

# Unions
Union types in TypeScript are a core feature that allow a value to be one of several specified types, providing flexibility in type definitions. They are defined using the `|` operator and are distinct from intersection types `&`, which require a value to satisfy all types.

For example, a variable of type `string | number` can hold either a string or a number. Union types are useful when a value could belong to different types depending on the context, allowing TypeScript to enforce type safety while accommodating flexibility.

### example:

```
let password: string | number = 1234
// setting password = "pass123" will also work.
// setting password = true brings an error
```

You can also place them in types and interfaced:
```
type Employee = {
  id: number | string;
  name: string;
};
```
