# Never in Typescript
In TypeScript, the never type means a function never finishes — it either throws an error or loops forever.

`never` means a function doesn’t just return nothing — it never returns at all.
It’s a powerful tool for expressing unreachable or impossible code in a type-safe way.

### When to Use never
* When a function never returns.
* In exhaustive checks to make sure all possible cases are handled.
* When you want to make it clear and safe that a certain code path should never be reached.


#### example: 
```
function throwError(message: string): never {
  throw new Error(message);
}
```

##### What’s Happening Here?
* The function throwError takes a string parameter called message.
* Inside the function, it throws an error using throw new Error(message).
* Since throwing an error immediately stops the function and control never returns, the function never completes normally.

🚨 Why never?
The return type never tells TypeScript:

“This function will never return a value, not even undefined.”

Unlike void, which means “returns nothing,” never means “it can’t return — it either crashes or loops forever.”
