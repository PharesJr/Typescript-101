# Void in Typescript
Void is a type that represents the **absence** of any value
In TypeScript, the void type means a function doesn't return any value.

### example:
```
function sayHello(): void {
  console.log("Hello!");
}
```
Here, **: void** tells TypeScript that the function doesn't return anything.
