# Enums
In TypeScript, an enum (short for enumeration) is a feature that allows you to define a set of named constants. Enums make it easier to work with sets of related constants by giving them meaningful names, which can improve code readability and maintainability. TypeScript supports both numeric and string-based enums.

### example:
Here's an example of a string enum:
```
enum Direction {
  Up = "UP",
  Down = "DOWN",
  Left = "LEFT",
  Right = "RIGHT",
}
```
## Benefits of Enums
* Readability: Enums make your code more readable by using descriptive names for sets of related constants.
* Type Safety: Enums provide type safety by restricting values to a predefined set of constants.
* Maintainability: Enums make it easier to maintain your code by centralizing the definition of related constants.
